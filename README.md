Presentation of my game :

In this game, you will need to memorize letters and their Morse code in a fun and challenging way, then transcribe them by pressing the spacebar: a short press for a dot (.) and a long press for a dash (-). Each round begins with a letter to memorize before you reproduce it in Morse code. You unlock new levels with each victory and can track your progress through statistics and high scores.

The game includes pause options (using the P key) to interrupt the game at any time, as well as the ability to return to the main menu (with the M key) or quit the game (using the Q key). The interface is simple and allows you to quickly pick up where you left off. Enjoy the game, and good luck becoming a Morse code expert!



How I do it :

In this project, I developed a memory-based game called *Morse Memory*. The game challenges players to remember and translate Morse code letters that are displayed briefly on the screen. The main idea behind the game is to help players improve their memory and understanding of Morse code through repeated practice. The game is structured with various interactive elements, such as menus, score tracking, and player data saving, to enhance user experience.

The game interface is built using the Pygame library, which allows for the creation of custom graphical interfaces and handling user inputs. It starts with a welcome screen where the player can choose to start a new game, view stats, or check unlocked levels. After choosing "Play," the player is prompted to enter their name, which is then used to track their progress and scores. The game flow consists of showing a random letter in Morse code for a short period, and then the player must reproduce it by pressing the spacebar for dots and dashes. The faster and more accurately the player enters the correct translation, the higher their score will be.

The game features a simple progression system where the player earns points for correct answers and loses points for mistakes. The score is displayed on the screen alongside a progress bar that indicates the player's input accuracy. The game also includes a pause function, where players can pause the game, return to the main menu, or quit. Player data, including the highest scores, are saved to a CSV file, ensuring that progress is retained across game sessions.

Overall, the project integrates fundamental game mechanics, such as user interaction, score tracking, and data persistence, into a fun and educational game that helps players learn Morse code.
